# Charge Master 2016 Serial Protocol

The Voltcraft (Conrad) Charge Master 2016 has a completely different protocol from the CM2010 and other devices.

The USB port is still a serial port which is `/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART` on my Mac. Every second the device sends a package with 19200 baud 8N1. I've written a simple python script to demonstrate reading and interpreting the data. For actual use you should add some error handling.

The script logs the running median of each value into seperate files for every slot, only once at start and then only when the values (except the time) changed. When the Slot gets "Idle", the file is closed, and a new one is started when the slot leaves "Idle".

Only one byte in the slot header is unknown (it seems the Windows software is also not using it) and the device header has a few semi-unknown ones (the version, the temperature, etc) â€“ only the chemical setting is actually used by the Window software.

Also, there is a live plot tool as in the original software. Just start it with the filename of a csv as a command line parameter to plot Voltage, Current and Charging / Discharging Capacity, updating live. If mode is "Charging", it shows the absolute charging capacity, if mode is "Discharging", it shows "(last) CCAP - DCAP". Discharging current is shown negative. Needs `pip install pandas` and `pip install matplotlib`.
